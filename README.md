# Python-for-Data-Sciences
Using python in order to order to  churn out interesting observations.

Python has many inbuilt libraries that make give the real meaning of Reusability. Tried exploring Pandas and till now has been worth the take.

# Panda stands for Python-based data analysis toolkit: 

import numpy as np 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  

# Compute the x and y coordinates for points on a sine curve 
x = np.arange(0, 3 * np.pi, 0.1) 
y = np.sin(x) 
plt.title("sine wave form") 

# Plot the points using matplotlib 
plt.plot(x, y) 
plt.show()
